# ToneZone

## Description
Are you tired of doing the same weekly workout routine? Well welcome to the ToneZone! A website we built in order to help people build workouts for the muscles they want to target. When the user picks an area of the body using the buttons on the side of our page, we will generate specific exercises to target that body part. We will also generate videos showing the user popular workouts from youtube so they can see proper form and get additional workout ideas.
